# CS50 Mini Projects
A series of short project assignments was completed while auditing the various Harvard CS50 courses.
## Languages learnt
- Python
- SQLLite3
- C
## Courses that I have audited
- CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science
- CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python
- CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python
- CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL
## Skills and concepts learnt
This is a non-exhaustive list of what I have learnt from these courses.
- Gained knowledge of many useful libraries from Python such as sys.
- Learned and practised ways to test my code as well as how to tackle edge cases.
- Developed defensive coding practices and other generally good practices in the field.
- Understand how to perform basic querying.
- What are primary keys and secondary keys and their differences.
- Using subqueries, grouping, joining, aggregate functions etc.
## How the courses helped me along my journey
Thanks to the SQL course, I learnt the basics of SQL very quickly which allowed me to move on to learning more complicated concepts such as CTEs and window functions. This allowed me to tackle some tricky SQL questions on LeetCode which is how I gained further knowledge in querying.  

Python is a useful and versatile tool for data analysis, science and engineering. It also has uses in many other fields hence I wanted to hone my skills in the language. I have used Python for many projects in and outside of academia. Now I aim to study libraries that specifically help with data analysis and visualisation such as Pandas and Seaborn. Had I not done these courses, my knowledge and confidence in Python would be lacking. This would mean I have to use valuable time to brush up on the language instead of diving into data straight away.
